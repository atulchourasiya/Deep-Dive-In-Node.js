## What is ejs
EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript, which is a templating language used to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript code. It allows you to create reusable templates that can dynamically generate HTML content based on data passed to them.

EJS is commonly used in web development with Node.js and Express framework, but it can also be used with other web frameworks or as a standalone library. It offers features such as conditional statements, loops, partials, and includes, which make it easy to create dynamic web pages and web applications.

One of the benefits of using EJS is that it is easy to learn and has a simple syntax that closely resembles regular HTML markup. Additionally, EJS  can be cached for faster rendering, which can improve the performance of your web application.
