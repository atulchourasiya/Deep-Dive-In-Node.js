# What is networking
  Back in old days about 20 year before if you want to share a file you might have to use the physical way like floppy disk or something this is the time when computer do not have network card but now a days we can easily share a file using internet this can be possible because of networking

  ## Component of network 
  - Ethernet Cable
  - Switch  
  - Network Card
    - every network card has a unique no. called MAC address

 ## Router
 The problem with switches is we cann't connect  whole world computers to the switches . there is a router came into picture .

 Router provide a one more layer. its job is a assign unique IP address to each computer and also to route data.

 In the ip address the first two portion kind of act like a group of same computer like 32.10.0.1 , 32.10.0.2 , 32.10.0.3 and so on

 Well along with the IP address you also have to remember the port. we can use different port to send different information. 

 ## ISP (Internet Service Provider)
 Many of us dont use router we buy a phone and insert a sim card to connect this huge network through ISP or internet service provider.

 ## 127.0.0.1 
 Home or loop back IP address this IP address is gonna back by the router to the very computer that send request 

 ## Server
 Any Computer that are configured to  takes a request and send back a response is a server
