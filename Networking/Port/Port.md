# Port
A port is the location where your application send the data. a safe option to set a port is above 1025 

Technically we can go as low a 4 but that are reserved port 

As long as you specify the port between 0 to 65535 you are fine to go

And also you can run two application on the same port if it just have different protocol 
- 8080 tcp
- 8080 udp
- 8080 another protocol
