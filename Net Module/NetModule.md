Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.

## TCP OR IPC 
if you specify a port or ip it is going to be a TCP server in NET.CREATESERVER() and if you specify a path it is going to be an IPC server

## What is socket 
A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
