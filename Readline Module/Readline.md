# Readline Module
The readline module in Node.js is a built-in module that provides an interface for reading input from readable streams, like the command line. It allows you to create interactive command-line interfaces by providing methods to read input line by line, handle user input, and more. This module is commonly used for building CLI (Command Line Interface) applications that require user interaction. It's a powerful tool for creating interactive and user-friendly command-line programs in Node.js.
